## ML Project - Tumor Growth Monitoring T08

Project done in the University of Tartu course Machine Learning.

The aim of the project was to test aquired knowledge in machine learning and apply it to real world application like detecting cancer tumor growth in MRI images of rats. During the project advanced deep learning techniques were applied, for segmentation and analysis 3D Convolutional Neural Networks was used. Scalability was in mind in the development of the project to be able to handle large datasets in the future if necessary. 

If the project is found to be a success, then it would be a potential candidate in helping to save time and reduce human error in tumor growth pattern analysis and having an impact in oncology and precision medicine.
